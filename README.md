# This repository contains my processing scripts for the long-term NSA AERI dataset 




## Appendix

All the files here are on the cluster Beluga. The scripts have not necessarily be cleaned for the audience to look. That might be done when a manuscript is submitted. I would appreciate any request before using this dataset and scripts, especially since many screening steps needed deep analysis and are not specifically indicated in my scripts.





## Installation

Requires the data and matlab compiler.
## Acknowledgements
Special thanks to Dr. Lei Liu for all his scripts, ideas and discussions regarding this analysis.
