This directory contains everything to process NSA Site E-AERI data. 
Matlab scripts are contained in ./matlabscripts 
Watch out, a lot of scripts are there, please refer to my Processing steps document (can be obtained directly upon request). 

All the data is divided between different folders ("data\_ch1", etc.). It is important to note that the 200510-200606 period has been processed from the S01 AERI and that the 2000-2008 period has been processed based on a neural network hatch status, which causes the overall 2000-2008 period to have less spectra. Nevertheless, the instrument was in slow sampling mode until ~2006. The 2009-2021 period is probably the richest in terms of data but my own research has shown an increase in noise with time (remaining reasonable). Please consider this.

The processed data is in the directory ./2023\_rolls\_2/ with the different steps in different subfolders.
